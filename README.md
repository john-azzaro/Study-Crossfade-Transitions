## What is Crossfade Transition Study?
Crossfade Transtions are used to blend two (or more) images or text areas together at a defined transparency. The "Crossfade Transition Study" demonstrates how this is accomplished with a simple image gallery and pure CSS.  The first image, which features the golden gate bridge, crossfades between a dusk image and day time image with gradual transition effects.  The second image, which featires a city skyline, crossfades between the skyline and a dark transparent background with descriptive text.

## Does Crossfade Transition Study feature commentary?
Yes! I use extensive commentary (mostly in the form of my thought process) so that the new and curious can follow the logic in the program and get an idea of my reasoning behind each and every line of code.  In addition to my line-by-line commantary, I also provide a Process text file that gives a good outline of my implementation process.
