Process Notes
===============

STEP 1: Setup your project folder and initial files
    o   In this case, we only need to use HTML and CSS.

STEP 2: Find the pictures you wan to use for your gallery and add them to a gallery images folder.

FOR IMAGE ON IMAGE CROSSFADE
============================

STEP 1: Create a div that will contain two images you want to crossfade between, which we call gallery-container in this study.

STEP 2: Setup the images match in size on top of the gallery background
    o   To do this, first create a gallery-container 
        o   During development, you can add  background color to see how it matches up to the images.
        o   Additionally, you can add a border if you want.  

    o   Then, select the images inside the gallery-container and match them to the same height and width.

            .gallery-container img {
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
            }

    o   What this does is tell the images inside the container to take the 100% height and 100% width of the container, which we had
        specified in the .gallery-container.

STEP 3: To get the second image to overlay over the first, you need to add a class to the second image.
    o   In the case of this study, it will be the golden gate bridge at dusk
    o   The class will be "crossfade-img".


STEP 3: For the "crossfade-img" css:
    o   First, set the position to absolute
