FOR IMAGE ON IMAGE CROSSFADE
============================

STEP 1: Create a div that will contain two images you want to crossfade between, which we call gallery-container in this study.

STEP 2: Setup the images match in size on top of the gallery background
    o   To do this, first create a gallery-container background size and color
    o   Then, select the images inside the gallery-container and match them to the same height and width.

            .gallery-container img {
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
