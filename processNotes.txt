Process Notes
===============

STEP 1: Setup your project folder and initial files
    o   In this case, we only need to use HTML and CSS.

STEP 2: Find the pictures you wan to use for your gallery and add them to a gallery images folder.

FOR IMAGE ON IMAGE CROSSFADE
============================

STEP 1: Create a div that will contain two images you want to crossfade between, which we call gallery-container in this study.

STEP 2: Setup the images match in size on top of the gallery background
    o   To do this, first create a gallery-container 
        o   First, we need to add "position: relative" because when we add the crossfade image, the position will be relative top
            the gallery-container and it will perfectly overlay.
        o   During development, you can add  background color to see how it matches up to the images.
        o   Additionally, you can add a border if you want.  

    o   Then, select the images inside the gallery-container and match them to the same height and width.

            .gallery-container img {
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
            }

    o   What this does is tell the images inside the container to take the 100% height and 100% width of the container, which we had
        specified in the .gallery-container.

STEP 3: To get the second image to overlay over the first, you need to add a class to the second image.
    o   In the case of this study, it will be the golden gate bridge at dusk
    o   The class will be "crossfade-img".

                    <div class="gallery-container">
                        <img src="./img/america-architecture-bay-208745.jpg" alt="golden gate during the day">
                        <img class="crossfade-img" src="./img/architecture-bridge-fog-1141853.jpg" alt="golden gate at dusk">          <== add class
                    </div>


STEP 3: For the "crossfade-img" css:
    o   First, set the position to absolute so that the crossfade image is outside the normal flow 
    o   Then, we need to remember that we set "position: relative" in the gallery-container, which will allow us to perfectly overlay the 
        crossfade image over the other.

                    .gallery-container {                                                                               
                        position: relative;                    <== realtive positioning inside the galler container
                        height: 500px;                                                                                        
                        width: 700px;                                                                                        
                        border: 10px solid black;                                                                           
                    }


    o   So because we set the positioning of "relative" (i.e. the positioning here is realtive to the positioning elsewhere), we can 
        have absolute positioning for element inside this container.

                    .crossfade-img {                                                                                     
                        position: absolute;                                                                                
                        top: 0;                                                                                            
                    }
